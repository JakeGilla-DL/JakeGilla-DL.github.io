### **Designing in Fear**
For me, the 'blank page', has never been as scary as the thought of the poorly written one.
To the surprise of no one that knows me, I have composed and scrapped at least a dozen
versions of this very post.  My tendency to not just trash, but disown work that doesn't meet expectations 
is also why this site wont likely have much content from my previous projects.  My work and
my craft have suffered from years of rotting, abandoned in poorly lit corners.

### **An Architect's Courage**
If you're reading this, if I'm not telling you about my intent to put up this site, or talking about how I've been hard
at work on an opening post, that means **I'm actually getting better**. I have to credit this improvement on my experience 
working with architects for the past 2 years; the brazenness of making a line on a computer that becomes a wall that will stand for 
decades, maybe centuries, and they just... do that for 8 hours a day!  

While my coworkers may not all be pillars of design virtuosity, the projects they work on do not elicit a budget that allows them to design 
at a lavel in line with their sensibilities.
So, if these architects can do that humbling, and ego draining work on a daily basis, if they can sit and listen to criticism from
clients and project managers, if they can suffer through design review board meetings, and bureaucrats, and red tape.... I think I can 
push myself to post a few screenshots or GIFs of the video game projects I've been working on.

### **A Path Forward**
So, what can you expect from the posts that follow?  The intent of this site is to post the projects I've been working on.  These 
posts will likely be centered around game design, but may also include posts around the design and upkeep of the site itself.
There will be writing, mostly around craft, but some critisim and analysis as well.  Finally, I thought it would be fun
to post simple pitches for games, levels, or features, and do conceptual exercises on how they could be built,
how they should be tested, what makes them fun, and what might be a problem.
 
None of the work I post will be perfect *(and I'm reminding myself here as much as warning you)*, and some may not really be that good.  If I 
can adjust my pursuit from *perfection* to *discussion* then maybe there's nothing to be afraid of after all.
