title: So, About this Site...

I'll be honest, web development has always somewhat irked me. I started programming by way of game development, where to start making something you picked an engine or framework, which dictated your language, and off you went (or vis vera).  Compare that to web development where you need HTML, CSS, maybe PHP, and some JavaScript just to get something cool going.  THis initial distaste was augmented by time working in IT infrastructure where us server folks always seemed to be at odds with crazy web developers that couldn't install a web cert, and seemed to be oblivious to how DNS works(yes, MX records ARE important!).
 
So, to put it simply, I have some biases. But when it came time to build this site I had some options: [Squarespace's](https://squarespace.com) marketing has permeated just about every one of my regular podcasts, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) obviously isn't going anywhere (nor is its subscription based cousin), and of course there are plently of LD's that just use [ArtStation](https://artstation.com).  While researching and weighing the options, I came across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages.  Static sites seemed like a training wheels version of web development: Pick a straightforward and well documented template, google your way through the syntax for Markdown and Ruby, and really only push HTML and CSS as far as you want to modify templates.  This will be easy!
 
What followed was a good 2 weeks of banging my head against the wall while hunting down different issues with Ruby, fighting with a ton of templates that didn't do quite what I wanted, and getting up to speed on the HTML & CSS side of things.  A lot of time was wasted on overly bloated templates that were not flexible enough (at least for this beginner) to do the job.  I finally settled on [Minimal-Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), a fitting descriptor for my time thus far with Jekyll!  After a couple hours poking at the MM template, I've got the basics: a blog and about me page, all ready to go.
 
This site is still lacking a ton of functionality I wanted, BUT it looks like the MM platform is excatly the base I need to start.  So, like all good projects, this site will be a perpetual WIP. Hopefully, anyone reading this is seeing something much more fully formed than what was here when I wrote this.

Cheers!
